# Fixing web exploits

## Considerations

• Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection? (maybe we have to ignore SSL certificates)

If HTTPs connection, add verify=False

```python
response  = requests.post(url, data=data, allow_redirects=False, verify=False)
```

• Does it access a web application specific path or route?

• Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?

• If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?

• How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability?

• Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?

• Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?

• Investigate functions/methods, debug the script with prints

**Side Note:** It's rare, but there have been times where I needed to remove the exploit comments at the top of the script in order for the script to run properly.&#x20;
