Fuzzing

Fuzz with OneListForAll -> api\* wordlists, also common.txt, raft-large-words-lowercase.txt

## API Bypassing

This is a bit of a unique one, as it can basically be anything. APIs are by definition incredibly versatile, and finding out how to exploit them, will require a lot of research and effort by the hacker. The following situation is only one possible scenario out of a near infinite number.

### Exploitation

We start off with a basic login.

Logging in gives us an admin panel.

It seems we can run system commands here, so let's try running id.

Woohoo! It seems we can run commands. But let's think for a second, we didn't really need to login at all, if we found the api.php page through dirsearching, and a cmd parameter through fuzz, we would never have needed to use the login panel.

If you find an api.php file, it's important to check it out on its own. It's probable that it won't be as easy as wfuzz to get command execution, but we may still be able to find useful information.

There is no way to automatically exploit this, we may be able to use tools we already know to get additional clues, but it will always take manual research
