## Mail

### Manage .mbox mailboxes (in case there are lots of emails)

`mutt -Rf Access\ Control.mbox` where `-R` opens it read-only (I don’t want to modify the file) and `-f` identifies the file to read from. I’ll answer a couple prompts (no I don’t want to create `/root/Mail`, yes remove the lock), and end up at the folder of emails (in this case, one). I can use arrow keys to move to the email I want, and press enter to view it. `q` gets back to the folder, and `q` again quits
